# Task Management System

A comprehensive task management console application designed for small developer teams to efficiently track and manage tasks for software product development.

## Project Description

Design and implement a Tasks Management console application. The application will be used by a small team of developers, who need to keep track
of all the tasks, surrounding a software product they are building.

## Functional Requirements

The application must support multiple teams.

### Teams

Each **team** must have a **name**, **members**, and **boards**.
- The name must be unique in the application.
- The name must be a string between 5 and 15 symbols.

### Members

Each member must have a **name**, list of **tasks** and **activity history**.
- The name must be unique in the application.
- The name must be a string between 5 and 15 symbols.

### Boards

Each board must have a **name**, list of **tasks** and **activity history**.
- Name must be unique in the team.
- Name is a string between 5 and 10 symbols.

### Tasks

There are 3 types of tasks: **bug**, **story**, and **feedback**.

#### Bug

Bugs must have an ID, a title, a description, a list of steps to reproduce it, a priority, a severity, a status, an assignee, a list of comments and a list of changes history.

- Title is a string between 10 and 50 symbols.
- Description is a string between 10 and 500 symbols.
- Steps to reproduce is a list of strings.
- Priority is one of the following: High, Medium, or Low.
- Severity is one of the following: Critical, Major, or Minor.
- Status is one of the following: Active or Fixed.
- Assignee is a member from the team.
- Comments is a list of comments (string messages with an author).
- History is a list of all changes (string messages) that were done to the bug.

#### Story

Stories must have an ID, a title, a description, a priority, a size, a status, an assignee, a list of comments and a list of changes history.

- Title is a string between 10 and 50 symbols.
- Description is a string between 10 and 500 symbols.
- Priority is one of the following: High, Medium, or Low.
- Size is one of the following: Large, Medium, or Small.
- Status is one of the following: Not Done, InProgress, or Done.
- Assignee is a member from the team.
- Comments is a list of comments (string messages with author).
- History is a list of all changes (string messages) that were done to the story.

#### Feedback

Feedbacks must have an ID, a title, a description, a rating, a status, a list of comments and a list of changes history.

- Title is a string between 10 and 50 symbols.
- Description is a string between 10 and 500 symbols.
- Rating is an integer.
- Status is one of the following: New, Unscheduled, Scheduled, or Done.
- Comments is a list of comments (string messages with author).
- History is a list of all changes (string messages) that were done to the
feedback.

Note: IDs of tasks must be unique in the application i.e., if we have a bug with ID 42 then we cannot have a story or a feedback with ID 42.

### Operations

The application must support the following operations:

- Create a new person.
- Show all people.
- Show a person's activity.
- Create a new team.
- Show all teams.
- Show a team's activity.
- Add a person to a team.
- Show all team members.
- Create a new board in a team.
- Show all team boards.
- Show a board's activity.
- Create a new Bug/Story/Feedback in a board.
- Change the Priority/Severity/Status of a bug.
- Change the Priority/Size/Status of a story.
- Change the Rating/Status of feedback.
- Assign/Unassign a task to a person.
- Add a comment to a task.
- Listing:
  - List all tasks (display the most important info).
    - Filter by title.
    - Sort by title.
  - List bugs/stories/feedback only.
    - Filter by status and/or assignee.
    - Sort by title/priority/severity/size/rating (depending on the task type).
  - List tasks with an assignee.
    - Filter by status and/or assignee.
    - Sort by title.

## Use Cases

### Use case #1

One of the developers has noticed a bug in the companyâ€™s product. He starts the application and goes on to create a new Task for it. He creates a new Bug and gives it the title "The program freezes when the Log In button is clicked." For the description he adds "This needs to be fixed quickly!", he marks the Bug as High priority and gives it Critical severity. Since it is a new bug, it gets the Active status. The developer also assigns it to the senior developer in the team. To be able to fix the bug, the senior developer needs to know how to reproduce it, so the developer who logged the bug adds a list of steps to reproduce: "1. Open the application; 2. Click "Log In"; 3. The application freezes!" The bug is saved to the application and is ready to be fixed.

### Use case #2

A new developer has joined the team. One of the other developers starts the application and creates a new team member. After that, he adds the new team member to one of the existing teams and assigns all Critical bugs to him.

### Use case #3

One of the developers has fixed a bug that was assigned to him. He adds a comment to that bug, saying "This one took me a while, but it is fixed now!", and then changes the status of the bug to Done. Just to be sure, he checks the changes history list of the bug and sees that the last entry in the list says, "The status of item with ID 42 switched from Active to Done."

## Technical Requirements

- Follow OOP best practices:
  - Use data encapsulation.
  - Use inheritance and polymorphism properly.
  - Use interfaces and abstract classes properly.
  - Use static members properly.
  - Use enumerations properly.
  - Aim for strong cohesion and loose coupling.
- Follow guidelines for writing clean code:
  - Proper naming of classes, methods, and fields.
  - Small classes and methods.
  - Well formatted and consistent code.
  - No duplicate code.
- Implement user input validation and display meaningful user messages.
- Implement proper exception handling.
- Prefer using the Streaming API, then using ordinary loops, wherever you can.
- Cover the core functionality with unit tests (at least 80% code coverage of the
models and commands).
  - There is no need to test the printing commands.
- Use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration.
